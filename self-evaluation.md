# Self-Evaluation

I understand the basic principles. My one issue was with the slice method.
I was able to successfully manipulate the array with slice, but the way it works
did not make sense to me. I'll have to do some more digging on that method.

I'd like to gain a better grasp on the machinations of using the parentheses,
like in pop();.

Also, what is the reason for including ; at the end of many lines of code?
